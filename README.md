ðŸ‘‹ðŸŒŽ Hi, Iâ€™m DÃ¼nya. I'm currently doing a Bioinformatics Master coming from a neuroscience background. My interests span a large variety of fields, from (artificial) intelligence to sustainability to societal governance. I aim to be involved in the startup scene and like to learn best practices in tech, product and business development, design and marketing. You can find out more about me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/dunya-baradari-007/ and read about my thoughts on my blog https://dunya-baradari.com/. âœ¨
